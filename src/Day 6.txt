Steps to solve system design interview

1. Ask requirement before creating design(i.e understand the scope and problem
    After intertvierer ask to design any product ask back the questions like specific requirement,Number of users,any feature for product
    etc
2.Create high level design:-
    • Come up with an initial blueprint for the design. Ask for feedback. Treat your
    interviewer as a teammate and work together. Many good interviewers love to talk and get
    involved.
    • Draw box diagrams with key components on the whiteboard or paper.
3. Deep dive:-
    You shall work with the interviewer to identify and prioritize components in the architecture.
    It is worth stressing that every interview is different. Sometimes, the interviewer may give off
    hints that she likes focusing on high-level design
4. Wrap up:-
    • The interviewer might want you to identify the system bottlenecks and discuss potential
    improvements. Never say your design is perfect and nothing can be improved. There is
    always something to improve upon.
    • It could be useful to give the interviewer a recap of your design.
    • Error cases (server failure, network loss, etc.) are interesting to talk about.
    • Operation issues are worth mentioning. How do you monitor metrics and error logs?
    How to roll out the system?

Dos
• Always ask for clarification. Do not assume your assumption is correct.
• Understand the requirements of the problem.
• There is neither the right answer nor the best answer. A solution designed to solve the
problems of a young startup is different from that of an established company with millions
of users. Make sure you understand the requirements.
• Let the interviewer know what you are thinking. Communicate with your interview.
• Suggest multiple approaches if possible.
• Once you agree with your interviewer on the blueprint, go into details on each
component. Design the most critical components first.
• Bounce ideas off the interviewer. A good interviewer works with you as a teammate.
• Never give up.
Don’ts
• Don't be unprepared for typical interview questions.
• Don’t jump into a solution without clarifying the requirements and assumptions.
• Don’t go into too much detail on a single component in the beginning. Give the highlevel design first then drills down.
• If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for hints.
• Again, communicate. Don't think in silence.
• Don’t think your interview is done once you give the design. You are not done until your
interviewer says you are done. Ask for feedback early and often.
