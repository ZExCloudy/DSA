Cache:- It's a temporary storage use for storing frequently stored data for faster response time

Cache tier:- a temporary layer to store cached data

Consider when to use cache :-

1. Expiration policy:- Cached data should be expired after certain amount of time that time
              should not be too less or too much

2. Mitigation failure:- This happend when we only have single cache layer in program so it
             become single point of failure(SPOF) to remove this add multiple cache layer

3. Consistency:- Cached data should be updated continuously with the db or it can send ambiguous data

4. Eviction policy:- After cache memory is full it should remove data based on FIFO or LFU(Least Frequently Used) data
