Horizontal scaling Vs Vertical scaling

Vertical:- Adding more RAM or storage etc to single server to make it powerfull
Pro's:- Simplicity is maintained
Con's :- You cannot add unlimited RAM or storage to server
         If one server is down whole system is down
         \
Horizontal:- Adding 1 or more server to divide incoming traffic
Pro's :- if one server is down other servers can take up task without downtime of system


Load balancer:-Used to divide traffic between multiple servers
Pro's :- Because of load balancer in middle client now cannot access server directly
         Better security

Database Replication:- Use of multiple database for data read/write

Most common method is master-slave:-
    where single pod of db is considered as master to do all write operations(i.e add,update,delete)
    and multiple db are used as slave for read operation
    In case of failure of master any one of the slave is promoted to master by running few scripts without any downtime

    Pro's:-
    1. Better performance:-  because of multiple databases we can run multiple queries in parrallel
    2. Reliability:- Due to data replicationif any one server is destroyed due to natural disaster we wont loose any darta
    3. High avvailability:- Due to multiple db across platform website willl still be functional if db is down by using another db
