Content Delivery Network(CDN)

It's geographicallty disposed server to load static content like images videos css javascript etc.

If someone from mumbai hit my web url it will redirect to nearest cdn server to load static content
and comeback with static pages if that CDN server does not have static content it will load it from origin
such as amazon s3

Consideration for using CDN:-

1. Cost :- CDN server are run by third party vendors and we are charged for each data sent and recived
            through them so checking out before will be beneficia;
2. Data expiry:- Same as cache layer if the data stored in CDN server is too old it can send wrong data to client
3. CDN fall back:- In case of CDN downtime client/user should be able to load content from origin
4.Invalidating files: You can remove a file from the CDN before it expires by performing
  one of the following operations:
  • Invalidate the CDN object using APIs provided by CDN vendors.
  • Use object versioning to serve a different version of the object. To version an object,
  you can add a parameter to the URL, such as a version number. For example, version
  number 2 is added to the query string: image.png?v=2.
