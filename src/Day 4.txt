Database Scaling:-

Vertical scaling:- Adding more power to single database like RAM or storage
 issues:- Single point of failure increased
            Hardware limits
            Horizontal scaling is high in cost


Horizontal scaling :- Adding more server also known as sharding

Most imp factor for sharding is to select sharding key that will determine how data will be distributed
Challenges while performing sharding

 1. Resharding database:- resharding will be required when
            1. overload of data on one shard due to rapid growth
            2. Exhaution of shard due to uneven data spread

 2. Celebrity issue:- If on application like instagarm jeff bezos,virat kohli and many celeb's
                        data are stored in same shard then that will be overused and failure can happen
